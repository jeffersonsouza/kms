- Write a program that prints ‘Hello World’ to the screen.
- Write a program that asks the user for their name and greets them with their name.
- Modify the previous program such that only the users Alice and Bob are greeted with their names.
- Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n
= Modify the previous program such that only multiples of three or five are considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 for n=17
- Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives them the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of 1,…,n.
- Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12.
- Write a program that prints all prime numbers. 
- Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small. At the end the number of tries needed should be printed. It counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.
- Write a program that prints the next 20 leap years.

- Write a function that returns the largest element in a list.
- Write function that reverses a list.
- Write a function that checks whether an element occurs in a list.
- Write a function that returns the elements on odd positions in a list.
- Write a function that computes the running total of a list.
- Write a function that tests whether a string is a palindrome.
- Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a list: using a for-loop, a while-loop and recursion.
- Write a function that concatenates two lists. e.g.: [a,b,c], [1,2,3] → [a,b,c,1,2,3]
- Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements, e.g. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] → [a,1,b,2,c,3].
- We are making n stone piles! The first pile has n stones. If n is even, then all piles have an even number of stones. If n is odd, all piles have an odd number of stones. Each pile must more stones than the previous pile but as few as possible. Write a Python program to find the number of stones in each pile
e.g.: 
Input: 10
Output:
[10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28]

- You now own some property and you want to calculate the total area of the property.
Create a program that:

Reads the width and height
Prints the area
Example: width = 5, height = 2
Output: total_area = 10

- You are interested in buying a new laptop. You check the price and you see that the price is 300$ without the 10% tax.

Create a program that:

Reads the price of the laptop
Reads the tax percentage
Prints the total amount
Output: "The total price of the laptop is 330$"

- In a company the monthly salary of an employee is calculated by: the minimum wage 400$ per month, plus 20$ multiplied by the number of years employed, plus 30$ for each child they have.

Create a program that:

Reads the number of years employed
Reads the number of children the employee has
Prints the total amount of salary the employee makes
Output: "The total amount is 560$. 400$ minimum wage + 100$ for 5 years experience + 60$ for 2 kids"

- The exercise is almost identical to a previous exercise with a minor change. In a company the monthly salary of an employee is calculated by minimum wage 400$ per month, plus 20$ multiply by the employment years, plus 30$ for each employee kid, plus 100$ if the employee didn't miss 1 day of work.

Create a program that:

Reads the employment years
Reads the number of each employee kids
Reads the number of missing days
Prints the total amount the employee must take
Output: "The total amount is 660$, 400$ minimum wage + 100$ for 5 years experience + 60$ for 2 kids + 100$ for not missing a day at work"

- You want to buy something from Amazon. The seller charges different prices for shipping cost based on location. For US it's 5$ for Europe it's 7$ for Canada it's 3$ for other places it's 9$

Create a program that:

Reads the cost of the product
Reads your location
Print the amount of money you have to pay
Ouput: "You have to pay 23$, 20$ for the product and 3$ for shipping cost"

- A cell phone company has the following billing policy

Fixed cost 25$
Call duration(in seconds)	Charge($/per second)
1-500                       0,01
501-800                     0,008
801+                        0,005

Create a program that:

Reads how many seconds was the calls duration
Calculates the monthly bill for the subscriber
Prints the total amount
Output: "total amount: 48$"
Notice that that the charge for the first 500 seconds it's 0,01$ then for the next 501 to 800 seconds it's 0,008 and then it's 0,005$
